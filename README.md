# Turing Complete export formats

This repo contains the various files needed for the export implementations in the game [Turing Complete](https://turingcomplete.game).

It does not contain the actual implementations of the export formats, those are build into the game itself.

## Formats

### verilog

Produces verilog files from schematics. Uses the various prebuild files in /verilog_files.

A bit of documentation for the export process is in [verilog_export.md](verilog_export.md)

### VHDL

Under construction

Will use the files under /vhdl_files

### C

Potentially planned, no promises at the moment :-)
